# Oceans
This code calculates and explains the correlations between (Sio2, Al2O3, TiO2) levels in different combinations of oceans and then creates a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.

Oceanic Chemical Analysis: Sio2, Al2O3, and TiO2

# Overview

This project involves the analysis of oceanic chemical data, specifically focusing on the concentration levels of three compounds: Silicon Dioxide (Sio2), Aluminium Oxide (Al2O3), and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) in different oceanic regions. The primary objective is to explore and visualize correlations between these compounds across various oceanic zones.

# Data

The data used in this project is stored in a CSV file, which includes separate columns for each compound in different oceans. Example columns include Sio2_Arctic, Al2O3_Atlantic, TiO2_Indiana, etc.

# Prerequisites

To run the analysis scripts, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
Ensure these libraries are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

---------------------------
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
---------------------------

# File Structure

ocean_data.csv: The CSV file containing oceanic chemical data.
analysis_script.py: Python script for analyzing the data and generating visualizations.

# Usage

To execute the analysis, run the analysis_script.py file. This script performs the following actions:

Loads the oceanic data from ocean_data.csv.
Calculates the correlation between different compounds' levels in different oceans.
Creates a heatmap visualization for each compound to illustrate the correlations.

# Visualizations

The script generates heatmaps that show the correlation between the levels of each compound in different oceans. A positive correlation indicates that as one compound's level increases, the other tends to increase as well, and vice versa for a negative correlation.

# Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please ensure to update the README file with details of changes made to the code or data.

This README template can be tailored further according to the specific needs of your project. You can add or modify sections to provide more details like contact information, license, specific instructions for contributing, or any other relevant information.
